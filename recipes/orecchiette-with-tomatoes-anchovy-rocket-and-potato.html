    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A simple, heart and summery pasta that needs little more than pantry essentials.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 garlic clove, crushed but left whole</li>
        <li>1 pinch chilli flakes</li>
        <li>6 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>12-15 cherry tomatoes, cut in half</li>
        <li>3-6 anchovy fillets, drained</li>
        <li>1 large potato, peeled and cut into 1cm cubes</li>
        <li>400g dried orecchiette pasta</li>
        <li>150g rocket</li>
        <li>toasted breadcrumbs, to serve</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a frying pan on a low heat, fry the garlic and chilli in the oil for a couple of minutes. Raise the heat, add the tomatoes and cook for 10 minutes, pressing them down with the back of a spoon, until they go saucy. In the final two minutes, add the anchovies and press with the spoon so they break.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, bring a big pan of water to a boil. Add salt, then add the potato. If using dried pasta, add it two minutes after the potato and the rocket six minutes later; if fresh, add it six minutes after the potato, along with the rocket.</li>
        <li>Once the pasta and potato are cooked, drain, then tip into the sauce in the frying pan and toss. Serve topped with a scattering of breadcrumbs, if you like.</li>
    </ol>
